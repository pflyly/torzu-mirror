<h4 align="center"><b>torzu</b> is a fork of yuzu, an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator.

It is written in C++ with portability in mind and runs on Linux, Windows and Android

## Fake websites

A lot of fake Torzu websites have popped up. These are not mine. **This project will not have a clearnet website for the foreseeable future!**
I highly advice against downloading anything from these websites, specially if their intention is clearly to make money through advertisements.

## Infrastructure back up online

There have been issues with the infrastructure running the main repository while I've been away from home. It should be all back and functional now!
Sorry for that!

## IRC chat

There's an IRC! Connect to `mao7u6s7jwxeof2fax2kwwqeabyevy5b2icbl24lhgnmkebbtmh37had.onion` port `6667` using your favorite client and join `#torzu`. Connecting via Tor might require a bit of setup but that shouldn't take much more than a quick web search to figure out.
Please **register your nicks**! 

## Compatibility

The emulator is capable of running most commercial games at full speed, provided you meet the [necessary hardware requirements](http://web.archive.org/web/20240130133811/https://yuzu-emu.org/help/quickstart/#hardware-requirements).

It runs most Nintendo Switch games released until the date of the Yuzu takedown.

## Goals

The first and foremost goal is long-term maintenance. Even if I stop commiting new features I will always do my best to keep the emulator functional and third party dependencies updated. This also means most of the changes made will eventually be bug fixes.
Essentially, the main goal is that you can still use this emulator on modern systems in 20 years.
It is very important to me that this project is going to be a good base to fork once grass has grown over the whole legal dilemma and people are willing to do real work on this emulator non-anonymously.

A secondary goal is the improvement of usability on low-end systems. This includes both improving the performance of the emulator as well as making games more playable below 100% speed whenever possible (the sync CPU to render speed limit option already helps with that in few cases).

## Development

All development happens on [Dark Git](http://vub63vv26q6v27xzv2dtcd25xumubshogm67yrpaz2rculqxs7jlfqad.onion/). It's also where [our central repository](http://vub63vv26q6v27xzv2dtcd25xumubshogm67yrpaz2rculqxs7jlfqad.onion/torzu-emu/torzu) is hosted.

To clone this git repository, use these commands (assuming tor is installed as a service and running):

```bash
git -c http.proxy=socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050 clone --depth 1 http://vub63vv26q6v27xzv2dtcd25xumubshogm67yrpaz2rculqxs7jlfqad.onion/torzu-emu/torzu.git
cd torzu
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Alternatively, you can clone from the [NotABug mirror repository](https://notabug.org/litucks/torzu):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://notabug.org/litucks/torzu.git
cd torzu
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Note that above repository may be taken down any time. Do not rely on its existence in production. In case the NotABug mirror goes down, another mirror will be most likely be set up on Bitbucket.

This project incorporates several commits from the [Suyu](https://suyu.dev) and [Sudachi](https://github.com/sudachi-emu/sudachi) forks, as well as changes listed in **Changes**.

## Move away from Codeberg

As requested by Codeberg staff, **I have removed the Codeberg mirror repository**. [The new mirror repository is on NotABug](https://notabug.org/litucks/torzu).
